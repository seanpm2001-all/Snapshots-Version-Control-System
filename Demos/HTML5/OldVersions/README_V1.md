# HTML5

My snapshot version control system originally developed from having to keep archives of old work during early-middle development of SNU (~April 2019-present) the `_snapshot` extension only fits for HTML files, all other files use `_V#` or `V#`

For this project, I am using the SNU (2D mode) RSS module as an example.
